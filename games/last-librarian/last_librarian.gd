	"In the distant future, the once mighty dominion of humanity lies on the brink of extinction, brought to the precipice by its own hubris and folly.",

	"Now, amidst the crumbling ruins of civilization, stripped of the knowledge that once defined its ascent, stands the Last Archiver.",

	"With this vast repository comes a solemn responsibility â€” to wield the power to restore or withhold, to guide or condemn. For she alone decides whether humanity will rise from its destruction or continue blindly towards demise."
